abstract = "In spite of the utility of unit tests, most R package developers do not write them. exampletestr makes it easier to start writing unit tests by creating shells/skeletons of unit tests based on the examples in the user's package documentation. When completed, these unit tests test whether said examples run correctly. By combining the functionality of `exampletestr` with that of `covr`, having ensured that their examples adequately demonstrate the features of their package, the developer can have much of the work of constructing a comprehensive set of unit tests done for them."
